{
  "Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH)": "Secreted by the hypothalamus, it stimulates the anterior pituitary to release growth hormone (GH). It plays a vital role in growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration."},
  {"Growth Hormone Inhibiting Hormone (GHIH) (Somatostatin)": "Also produced by the hypothalamus, it inhibits the release of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary. It also inhibits the release of other hormones like TSH and insulin."},
  {"Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH)": "Released by the hypothalamus, it stimulates the anterior pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn controls the thyroid gland."},
  {"Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH)": "Produced by the hypothalamus, it triggers the anterior pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol."},
  {"Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)": "Secreted by the hypothalamus, it stimulates the anterior pituitary to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are crucial for reproductive function."},
  {"Dopamine (Prolactin-Inhibiting Hormone (PIH))": "known as a neurotransmitter, it is produced by the hypothalamus and acts as a hormone by inhibiting the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary."},
  {"Growth Hormone (GH)": "Secreted by the anterior pituitary, it stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration. It also plays a role in metabolism."},
  {"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)": "Released by the anterior pituitary, it stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, a hormone involved in stress response, metabolism, and immune function."},
  {"Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)": "Secreted by the anterior pituitary, it stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), which regulate metabolism."},
  {"Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)": "Released by the anterior pituitary, in females, it stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles and estrogen production; in males, it stimulates sperm production."},
  {"Luteinizing Hormone (LH)": "Secreted by the anterior pituitary, in females, it triggers ovulation and stimulates progesterone production; in males, it stimulates testosterone production."},
  {"Prolactin": "Released by the anterior pituitary, it primarily stimulates milk production after childbirth. It also has roles in reproductive function and immune regulation."},
  {"Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) (Vasopressin)": "Stored and released by the posterior pituitary (but produced in the hypothalamus), it regulates water balance by increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys."},
  {"Oxytocin": "Stored and released by the posterior pituitary (but produced in the hypothalamus), it plays a role in social bonding, childbirth (uterine contractions), and milk ejection."},
  {"Melatonin": "Produced by the pineal gland, it regulates sleep-wake cycles (circadian rhythms). Its production increases in darkness and decreases in light."}
